# Pima Indians Diabetes detection based on diagnostic measures.
The goal of this project is to build a reliable machine learning model to diagnose if a person has diabetes or not based on clinical data input provided with high precision.

This is a classification problem to determine if a patient has diabetes or not.

The clinical data that will be used in this project has been provided by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
